Exynos Dynamic Memory Controller

The device node for an DM controller that is part of an Exynos
SOC is as described in the document "Open Firmware Recommended
Practice : Universal Serial Bus" with the following modifications
and additions :

Required properties :
 - compatible : Should be "samsung,exynos-dmc" for SROMC controllers
 - mem-interleave-size: Memory interleaving size, normally 0x1f
 - mem-type : Memory type as a string. Valid options are:
     ddr2
     ddr3
     lpddr2
     lpddr3
 - mem-manuf : Memory manufacturer as a string. Valid options are:
     elpida
     samsung
 - clock-frequency : Clock frequency of the memory in Hz.
 - arm-frequency : Clock frequency of the ARM CPUs in Hz.

TODO(sjg@chromium.org): Perhaps move this into another clock node if one
is created in the future.

Example:

dmc@10C00000 {
	compatible = "samsung,exynos-dmc";
	mem-interleave-size = <0x1f>;
	mem-type = "ddr3";
	mem-manuf = "elpida";
	clock-frequency = <800000000>;
	arm-frequency = <1700000000>;
};
